This repository contains the implementation of a **Book Recommendation System** developed in **Python** using **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface. The project was created as part of coursework focused on **data structures, control structures, and graphical user interface design**.

## üìñ Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to recommend books to users based on their preferences. Users can specify their preferred **genre** or **author**, and the system will provide personalized recommendations. The system utilizes a list of books, filtering and ranking them to ensure that the user receives relevant suggestions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: For implementing the core logic and functionality of the recommendation system.
- **Tkinter**: For creating an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Personalized Book Recommendations**: Users receive book suggestions based on their input preferences for genre or author.
- **Interactive GUI**: The project includes a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, making it easy for users to input their preferences and view recommendations.
- **Use of Data Structures and Control Logic**: The system demonstrates effective use of Python's data structures (e.g., dictionaries and lists) and control structures to filter and present book recommendations.
